NBA Championship Prediction using Linear Regression and Geospatial Visualization

Project Overview
This project aims to predict which National Basketball Association (NBA) team has the highest probability of winning the championship by analysing historical team performance data. 
Using linear regression models trained on regular-season statistics, we identify key performance metrics that are most strongly associated with team success and visualise the results on a 
geospatial map of NBA teams. The project was completed as part of ES2001: Computational Earth Systems Science and demonstrates the application of data processing, statistical modelling, 
and visualisation techniques using real-world sports data.

Objectives
- Identify team-level metrics that best explain variations in NBA win percentage
- Build predictive models to estimate team win probabilities
- Compare different feature-selection strategies across multiple models
- Visualise predicted outcomes geographically using team home locations
